# Credit card approval model

##  Introduction

Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.

This notebook aim to create an model to predict the chance to approve or reject customer's request for new credit card. The model should be balance between business's revenue and the customer's eligibility.

## Dataset
The data was downloaded with some modification from [Kaggle Credit Card approval prediction dataset](http://www.google.fr](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction/ "Kaggle link").

The main purpose for this practice:

**1. Apply and understand PCA in feature reduction**

**2. Use XGBoost and RF to build a prediction model**

Apply SMOTE to fix the imbalance problem

**3. Analysis result based on Recall/ Precision**
